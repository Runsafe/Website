<p>With Huckleberry now in the works we thought it would be a nice to spice up the monthly creative competition with something a big more fitting! Rather than building something creative on the server with a theme, this months competition is to design a new ore! The winning design will be implemented into Huckleberry before it's beta release!</p>
<p>Check the list of things your submission will need below!</p>
<ul id="comp-list">
	<li>A name for the ore.</li>
	<li>What does it smelt into?</li>
	<li>Include a sprite for the ore based off the default texture pack</li>
	<li>Where does it spawn in the world?</li>
	<li>How common is the ore?</li>
</ul>
<p>Send your submissions (completed) to kruithne@runsafe.no before the end of July!</p>
